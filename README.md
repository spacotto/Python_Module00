# Python Module 00
An introduction to Python fundamentals through community garden data analysis. This module teaches **basic syntax** and **semantics**, including **expressions**, **variables**, **functions**, and **control flow** through practical, real-world (sort of) exercises.

## Exercise 0: Hello Garden
- [Function definition](https://github.com/spacotto/grimoire/blob/main/python/fn_definition.md)
- [`print` function](https://github.com/spacotto/grimoire/blob/main/python/print.md)

## Exercise 1: Garden Plot Area
- Multiplication
```python
area = x * y
```
- [Variables](https://github.com/spacotto/grimoire/blob/main/python/variable.md)
- Data Types & Data Casting
- [`input()` function](https://github.com/spacotto/grimoire/blob/main/python/input.md)

## Exercise 2: Harvest Total
- Sum calculation
```python
total = x + y + z
```
  
## Exercise 3: Plant Age Check
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)

## Exercise 4: Water Reminder
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)

## Exercise 5: Count to Harvest
- [Iteration](https://github.com/spacotto/grimoire/blob/main/python/iteration.md)
- [Recursion](https://github.com/spacotto/grimoire/blob/main/python/recursion.md)

>[!NOTE]
>Both iteration and recursion can solve the same problem differently.

## Exercise 6: Garden Summary
-

## Exercise 7: Seed Inventory with Type Annotations
-

>[!TIP]
>If you want to test `ex7` with different parameters, you can call the function directly in the terminal. Open your terminal and enter `python3`. Then import your file and function:
>```
>from ft_seed_inventory import ft_seed_inventory
>```
>Now you can call the function without needing a main:
>```
>ft_seed_inventory("tomato", 15, "packets")
>```
